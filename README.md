This github repo contains my personal website garettmorrison.net
I use Hugo to generate the site and netlify to host it. 

I wouldn't reccommend cloning and modifying this repo as it has a bunch of undocumented changes to Hugo templates I'm borrowing from, but I would strongly reccommend the same toolchain for hosting a personal website. It's straightforward to get started with easy templates, but still lets you modify the source code if you want to. The following are links to the tutorials I followed that got a basic site online in an afternoon. 

[Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
Hugo is a framework for building websites. It lets you work with a template, writing content in markdown without having to dig through a bunch of HTML.  

[Hosting and Deploying on Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/)
Netlify is an easy to use website hosting service with a good free tier. It also plays nicely with Hugo and Github. This setup automatically pulls your Hugo site when you push it to Github and updates it online. 

[Connecting Google Domain to Netlify](https://medium.com/@jacobsowles/how-to-deploy-a-google-domains-site-to-netlify-c62793d8c95e)
Finally, literally just to get rid of the .netlify.app at the end of the website address, I got a Google domain for 12$ a year. It can take a bit to set up as you have to wait a few days for some changes to take effect.
