The engineering behind musical instruments has always fascinated me. From massive pipe organs to [Wintergaten's Marble Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q),

For some time, I've wanting to make an autonomous, robotic instrument. There are a number of remarkable self-playing instruments projects, but every one I've seen requires being carefully set up and tuned before playing. Even the computer controlled buildsare usually calibrated by hand, sending different control signals and tweaking to find each note. This is very time intensive, and neccessitates either tuning ever single voice separately or
