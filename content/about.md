I am a junior engineering student at Texas A&M University. I'm majoring in Mechatronics, which is a blend of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, with minors in Computer Science and Embedded Systems. My primary interests are computing, mechanical design, and robotics. This website exists to document my projects exploring these subjects. I want to continue to explore the intersection of AI and robotics, and hope to become employed in this field.
