I am a sophomore engineering student at Texas A&M University. I'm majoring in Mechatronics, which is a blend of mechanical and electrical engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. My primary interests are computers and robots, which I intend to document with this website, work in progress as it is. I want to continue to explore the intersection of AI and robotics, and hope to become employed in this field.
