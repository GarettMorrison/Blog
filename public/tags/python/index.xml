      <description>There are a number of projects I am either still working on or have not yet written a full post about. This page is a way for me to track progress and have an online record of things that I am currently working on.
 PlantSim I am fascinated by emergent behavior in systems, and frequently program simulations to experiment with these properties. This particular sim is a cell placement evolution sim.</description>

      <description>My family has a long and illustrious history of going backpacking in Big Bend National Park. For my sister&amp;rsquo;s birthday last year, I laser cut her a 3D topographical map of The Chisos Basin, one of our favorite locations in the park. This is a precise scale model, modeled by interpreting real world data with python.
The most challenging part of the project was locating a usable heightmap image. I dug through mapping sites and United States Geological Survey data, but what I ultimately used was terrain.</description>
