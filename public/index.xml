      <description>My family has a long and illustrious history of going backpacking in Big Bend National Park. For my sister&amp;rsquo;s birthday last year, I laser cut her a 3D topographical map of The Chisos Basin, one of our favorite locations in the park. This is a precise scale model, modeled by interpreting real world data with python.
The most challenging part of the project was locating a usable heightmap image. I dug through mapping sites and United States Geological Survey data, but what I ultimately used was terrain.</description>

      <description>I am a sophomore engineering student at Texas A&amp;amp;M University. I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in Mechatronics, which is a blend of mechanical and electrical engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. My primary interests are computers and robots, which I intend to document with this website, work in progress as it is. I want to continue to explore the intersection of AI and robotics, and hope to become employed in this field.</description>
