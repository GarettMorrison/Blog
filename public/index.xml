After considering several options I settled on roller blades, as they posed an interesting set of challenges. Creating wearables is a distinctly different area of design from my previous projects, as human bodies tend not to fit well with the straight lines and hard edges that CAD lends itself to.</description></item><item><title>Laser Cut Topographical Map</title><link>https://garettmorrison.net/posts/laser-cut-topography/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 00:51:29 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://garettmorrison.net/posts/laser-cut-topography/</guid><description>My family has a long and illustrious history of going backpacking in Big Bend National Park. For my sister&amp;rsquo;s birthday last year, I laser cut her a 3D topographical map of The Chisos Basin, one of our favorite locations in the park.

I&amp;rsquo;m majoring in Mechatronics, which is a blend of mechanical and electrical engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. My primary interests are computers and robots, which I intend to document with this website, work in progress as it is. I want to continue to explore the intersection of AI and robotics, and hope to become employed in this field.</description></item></channel></rss>
