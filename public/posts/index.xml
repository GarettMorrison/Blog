<p>At the start of this semester I set a goal for myself: creating some form of personal transportation. After considering several options I settled on roller blades, as they posed an interesting set of challenges. Creating wearables is a distinctly different area of design from my previous projects, as human bodies tend not to fit well with the straight lines and hard edges that CAD lends itself to.</p>
<p>As is usual with my personal projects, I wanted to keep the budget as cheap as possible. That&rsquo;s why I now own what may be the only pair of wooden laser-cut  roller blades in existence. Using cheap wheels and axles off amazon and some straps, I made my first prototype, which strapped on over my shoes.</p>


<div class="row">
	<div class="column">
		<img src="/img/roller/Roller_V1_Front.jpg" alt="Front" style="width:100%">
		<img src="/img/roller/Roller_V1_Side.jpg" alt="Side" style="width:100%">
	</div>

	</div>
</div>

<p>As is apparent from the concerning crack at the end of the clip, V1 was destined for a short lifespan. On my next ride one of the calf supports snapped, and with it my hopes of not spending another afternoon waiting for wood to burn and glue to dry.</p>
<p>With Version 2, I intended to resolve the oversights and errors of the first. In addition to fixing the handful of CAD errors making assembly frustrating, I added a second, interior, calf strap to reduce stress on the first one. By making spacers, I was able to more precisely adjust the fit of the blades to it&rsquo;s user. I also adjusted the locations of the foot straps, to more securely lock down the wearers shoe to the structure. The result was a more comfortable, more reliable roller blade.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p>I consider this project to be a resounding success, and have used them a number of times wandering around my neighborhood. I may create a version 3, with proper brakes and cushioning that doesn&rsquo;t require you to wrap a washcloth around your legs, but for now I am just happy that I managed to create something usable for ~50$.</p>

<p>My family has a long and illustrious history of going backpacking in Big Bend National Park. For my sister&rsquo;s birthday last year, I laser cut her a 3D topographical map of The Chisos Basin, one of our favorite locations in the park. This is a precise scale model, modeled by interpreting real world data with python.</p>

<p>The most challenging part of the project was locating a usable heightmap image. I dug through mapping sites and United States Geological Survey data, but what I ultimately used was <a href="http://terrain.party" title="terrain.party">terrain.party</a>, a website for exporting real world data for cities skylines maps. I calculated the scale of the image by comparing the distances between cliff faces to the scale on google maps. From this I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/GarettMorrison/HeightMapSplicer" title="github.com/GarettMorrison/HeightMapSplicer">python script</a> using Pillow and some geometry to generate an image of each layer side by side, which I fed into a DXF <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/dxf-to-svg" title="cloudconvert.com">converter</a>, which produced a cuttable file. The final product is a little under 2 feet square, cut from hardboard.</p>

<p>I was later asked to reproduce the project for a map of Texas for an installation in the Zachry Engineering Building. While testing my script I generated files for one of my favorite ridiculous creations, Tall Texas, which I couldn&rsquo;t resist cutting out.</p>
