            <description>My family has a long and illustrious history of going backpacking in Big Bend National Park. For my sister&amp;rsquo;s birthday last year, I laser cut her a 3D topographical map of The Chisos Basin, one of our favorite locations in the park. This is a precise scale model, modeled by interpreting real world data with python.
The most challenging part of the project was locating a usable heightmap image. I dug through mapping sites and United States Geological Survey data, but what I ultimately used was terrain.</description>

<p>My family has a long and illustrious history of going backpacking in Big Bend National Park. For my sister&rsquo;s birthday last year, I laser cut her a 3D topographical map of The Chisos Basin, one of our favorite locations in the park. This is a precise scale model, modeled by interpreting real world data with python.</p>

<p>The most challenging part of the project was locating a usable heightmap image. I dug through mapping sites and United States Geological Survey data, but what I ultimately used was <a href="http://terrain.party" title="terrain.party">terrain.party</a>, a website for exporting real world data for cities skylines maps. I calculated the scale of the image by comparing the distances between cliff faces to the scale on google maps. From this I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/GarettMorrison/HeightMapSplicer" title="github.com/GarettMorrison/HeightMapSplicer">python script</a> using Pillow and some geometry to generate an image of each layer side by side, which I fed into a DXF <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/dxf-to-svg" title="cloudconvert.com">converter</a>, which produced a cuttable file. The final product is a little under 2 feet square, cut from hardboard.</p>

<p>I was later asked to reproduce the project for a map of Texas for an installation in the Zachry Engineering Building. While testing my script I generated files for one of my favorite ridiculous creations, Tall Texas, which I couldn&rsquo;t resist cutting out.</p>
